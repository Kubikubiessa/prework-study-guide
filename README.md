## Description

The Prework Study Guide was motivated by building a resource that will prepare me for the coding boot camp and serve as study guide. I engaged in ths projcet for practice and in order to have a study resource. 
The PRework Study Guide helps to start the coding boot camp and be prepared. I learned about the digital infratructure of coding and was introduced to many aspects of the work as a coder. I learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and GitHub, the terminal, and lots more.
